This project will reformulate the Sparsity Propagation Analysis (SPA) as a static 
analysis within the MLIR framework, targeting the linalg dialect. The analysis 
will represent the abstract domain of sparsity vectors, transfer functions and 
propagation strategies and rules as an MLIR pass. The results of the analysis 
will be exposed back to the IR as metadata that can be used for further 
transformations, optimizations and lowering passes. This approach will allow for 
a more modular and extensible implementation of SPA, that can be used across 
different applications, without being constrained to computational graphs or the 
TACO compiler.
