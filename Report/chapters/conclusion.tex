This proposal has presented a comprehensive plan for the reformulation of 
the Sparsity Propagation Analysis (SPA), using the MLIR compiler
infrastructure.
The proposed approach aims to leverage MLIR's 
structured intermediate representations, along with its pass and transformation frameworks,
to provide an extensible, efficient and modular framework for sparsity propagation
analysis. With the adoption of MLIR, SPA would be disjointed from the TACO compiler, 
and it would be reusable across a wider range of applications and domains, with 
minimal engineering effort. Although the initial implementation targets the \emph{linalg}
dialect, the design naturally generalizes across other dialects as well, enabling
future extensions.
This work aims to demonstrate how SPA can be elevated from a compiler specific 
optimization, to a generalized, reusable IR-level optimization within the MLIR 
compiler ecosystem.
