    Sparsity in tensors and tensor slices is common in many application domains,
    including machine learning workloads and stencil-based solvers for partial
    differential equations. Exploiting this sparsity is critical for reducing
    memory footprint and avoiding redundant computation in compiler-generated code.
    Prior work has explored a range of sparse representations and techniques
    for propagating known sparsity information across computational graphs.
    Recent work by the Compilers Lab at UFMG introduced Sparsity Propagation Analysis
    (SPA), a static analysis that propagates sparsity information in a multidirectional
    manner across computational graphs, enabling significant performance and memory improvements.
    However, the existing implementation of SPA is tightly coupled to the Tensor
    Algebra Compiler (TACO), making its adoption in other compilers and domain-specific
    languages costly in terms of engineering effort. This proposal addresses this
    limitation by reformulating SPA within the MLIR compiler infrastructure.
    By leveraging MLIR’s pass and transformation frameworks, the proposed approach
    aims to provide an extensible, efficient, and portable implementation of sparsity
    propagation analysis that can be reused across different dialects and compilation
    pipelines within the MLIR ecosystem.
